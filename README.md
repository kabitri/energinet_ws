# energinet_ws

This project will focus on the price analysis from whole sale electricity markets. Data is from Energinet.
This will mainly include analysis of the following:
- amount of spot purchased
- amount of spot sold
- spot prices

Additionally data is available from the intra-day Elbas market, which can be used if necessary.
